Code Book
==========
subjectid - the id of the subject being measured
activity - the name of the activity being measured

The rest of the column names are coded in the folowing way:

time - Measurments starting with the word time are time domain signals that were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
FFT - Measurments starting with the letters FFT are time domain signals that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to them.
BodyAcceleration - The body acceleration signal.
GravityAcceleration - The gravity acceleration signal.
Jerk - Jerk signals.
Magnitude - The magnitude of three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
mean - Mean value.
std - Standard deviation.
-XYZ - Used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

For example: timeGravityAcceleration-std-y is the standard deviation of the time measurment of the gravity acceleration signal.
